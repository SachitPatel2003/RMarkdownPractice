# RMarkdownPractice
Barebones RMarkdown.

This is a very short script on first steps in using RMarkdown. I initially attempted to use ggscatter, but I was getting issues with not reading the Y Variable properly. I generated a plot output, and the markdown is an html output. I have never used RMarkdown before, so I took baby steps into it.
